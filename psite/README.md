こんにちは！

This is my personal website's source code README.md. You're sure doing a lot of digging to end up here.

My name is Hailey Chan. I am an ENFP 4w3, a product designer, and a student at the
University of Waterloo for Computer Science. I intend to specialize in Human-Computer
Interaction with a minor in Digital Arts Communications.

I revel in the intersection of creative, human-centric design and front-end development.

Connect with me!

xoxo,
Hailey
